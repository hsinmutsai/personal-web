I gave a talk titled "Connecting Vehicles with Light" at CECI on June 17. The talk is recorded and released by them on ([YouTube](https://youtu.be/4uBOJcxJBwA)). The talk is in Mandarin Chinese.

The talk is about the opportunities created by connecting vehicles with communication links, allowing them to share information and jointly coordinate their behaviors on the roads. Even the simplest coordination could lead to improved fuel efficiency and increased road capacity. Then I shared some of the latest experimental results from our vehicular visible light communication prototype. Please enjoy the talk. :-)
