title: IEEE VNC 2018 in Taipei
---

I served as general co-chair (together with Dr. Onur Altintas, Toyota InfoTech) of IEEE Vehicular Networking Conference 2018 ([Website](http://www.ieee-vnc.org)) and led the organizing committee to plan for the event in Taipei. 

The conference took place in the historic Sungshan Cultural and Creative Park, which was constructed in 1937 as a tobacco factory by the Japanese government. In 2001, this factory was appointed by the Taipei City Government as the No. 99 cultural heritage site of the city and was turning into a creative park in 2011. The event was a great success, with 100+ submissions and 100+ attendees in the 3-day event.
