title: 2024 Fall - CSIE3015 Computer Science and Information Technology (I)
---

In this course, we will invite faculty members from Department of Computer Science and Information Engineering to give short lectures (2 x 3-hour classes), introducing their research areas to the students. The students can have a deeper understanding of various research areas and applications, which prepare them to do advanced research.
